# Spectre Encoding System 

## Purpose:
The Spectre Encoding system is designed to encode hidden messages using zero-width characters in a way that is stealthy and robust. This document explains the encoding and decoding processes in full, including the Spectre Encoding Table.

## Spectre Encoding Overview:

1. **Encoding Format**:
   - Each plaintext character is represented by a **quad** in the form of `xccc`:
     - `x`: A random zero-width character (noise character) chosen from the following set:
       - ​ (Zero-Width Space) U+200B
       - ‌ (Zero-Width Non-Joiner) U+200C 
       - ‍ (Zero-Width Joiner) U+200D
       - ﻿ (Zero-Width No-Break Space) U+FEFF
       - ⁠ (Word Joiner) U+2060
     - `ccc`: A triplet of zero-width characters representing the plaintext character, as per the Spectre Encoding Table.

2. **Encoding Process**:
   - For each plaintext character:
     - Select a random `x` from the zero-width set.
     - Retrieve the corresponding `ccc` from the Spectre Encoding Table.
     - Combine `x` and `ccc` to form the quad (`xccc`).
   - Combine all quads to form the encoded message.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - Parse the encoded message into quads of length 4.
   - Ignore the first character (`x`) in each quad.
   - Map the remaining triplet (`ccc`) back to its corresponding plaintext character using the Spectre Encoding Table.
   - Combine the plaintext characters to retrieve the original message.

## Spectre Encoding Table:
Here is the full mapping of plaintext characters to their corresponding triplets (`ccc`):

## General Notes:
- The Spectre Encoding system is stealthy and relies on zero-width characters for invisibility in most text editors.
- Noise characters (`x`) add obfuscation, making the encoding harder to detect or reverse-engineer.
- Ensure strict adherence to this table for encoding and decoding processes.
